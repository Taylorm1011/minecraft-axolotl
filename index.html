        <h2> What are Minecraft Axolotls?</h2>
        <p> Axolotls are one of the newest mobs in minecraft. 
            Minecraft players can find these mobs under water and interact with them. 
            Unfortunately you can not tame axolotls like wolf or a cat. 
            They also help players with underwater exploration and fight other underwater mobs.
             axolotls come in five colors and those are Leucistic, cyan, blue, gold, and brown. 
             The rarest axolotl color is blue and There is a 0.083% (1/1200) chance of spawning blue axolotl when two axolotls are bred. </p>
        <h2>Axolotl Behvaviors</h2>
        <p> Axolotls are passive towards players. 
            They attack all aquatic mobs except for dolphins, turtles, frogs and other axolotls. 
            They also attack drowned. 
            Axolotls will always attack a hostile mob first before any non-hostile mob. 
            Axolotls play dead if they take damage under water and while playing dead they regenerate. 
            while an axolotl is healing hostile mobs will ignore them. 
            Axolotls can walk around on land unlike other aquatic animals. They help players fight mobs under water. 
            Not only that they help with fishing since they beat up other aquatic animals.  </p>
            <h2> spawning </h2>
            <p> they spawn in lush caves</p>
